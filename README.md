# Net-Zero-Agriculture-in-Pakistan
# Project Overview

This project applies environmental analytics to assess the feasibility of achieving net-zero emissions in Pakistan’s agricultural sector, which currently contributes approximately 41% of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using long-run emissions data, the project identifies emission trends, pollutant hotspots, governance gaps and proposes SBTi-aligned, data-driven policy recommendations. The analysis is written from the perspective of a senior policy or sustainability decision-maker, translating quantitative insights into actionable climate strategy.

# Problem Context

Pakistan has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, yet agriculture remains:

- Emissions-intensive

- Poorly monitored

- Weakly regulated

- Misaligned with science-based targets

Despite decades of rising emissions, the sector lacks:

- A dedicated net-zero roadmap

- Robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems

- Emissions-linked incentives or accountability mechanisms

This project addresses these gaps using environmental data analytics.

# Data Sources

The project relies exclusively on secondary, open-access data.

## Primary Dataset

- EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)

- **Coverage:** 1970–2022

- **Sector:** Agriculture (Pakistan)

## Emissions Covered

- **Greenhouse Gases:** CO₂, CH₄, N₂O (CO₂-equivalent)

- **Air Pollutants:** NH₃, NOx, CO, SO₂, Black Carbon

- **Toxic Pollutant:** Mercury (Hg)

The dataset enables long-term trend analysis and source-level hotspot identification for selected pollutants.

# Methodology

The analytical workflow follows a structured environmental analytics approach:

- Data cleaning and structuring for statistical and visual analysis

- Descriptive statistics to establish baseline emissions behaviour

- Trend analysis across 52 years of longitudinal data

- Hotspot identification for NH₃ and NOx emissions by source

- Correlation analysis (Pearson) between time and emission variables

- System-level policy gap analysis

- Ethical risk assessment (data integrity, equity, greenwashing)

# Tools Used

- SPSS for descriptive statistics and correlation analysis

- Tableau for emissions visualisation and trend exploration

- Excel for data preparation and structuring

# Key Findings
## Emissions Trends

- Agricultural GHG emissions increased by ~268% (1970–2022)

- Strong, statistically significant positive correlations between time and all pollutants

- Emissions growth is systemic, not cyclical or random

## Pollutant Hotspots

- Agricultural soils dominate NH₃ and NOx emissions

- Manure management is a rapidly growing secondary source

- Crop residue burning contributes disproportionately to air and toxic pollutants

## Structural Failures Identified

- No SBTi-aligned agriculture emissions roadmap

- Distortionary fertiliser subsidies encouraging overuse

- Absence of compulsory manure management standards

- Weak sub-national emissions governance

- Limited transparency and MRV infrastructure

# Strategic Recommendations

The project proposes five targeted, data-backed interventions:

- National Agriculture Emissions Strategy

- Sector-specific net-zero pathway with provincial targets

- Fertiliser Subsidy Reform

- Shift to emissions-weighted, soil-test-linked subsidies

- Provincial Climate Units (PCUs)

- Sub-national MRV, dashboards, and emissions governance

- National Manure Management Code

- Mandatory storage standards and biogas incentives

- Agriculture Carbon Council

- Centralised climate governance and finance coordination

Each recommendation includes clear KPIs and implementation timelines.

# Ethical Considerations

The project explicitly addresses:

- Data ethics and analytical integrity

- Equity and just transition risks for smallholder farmers

- Bias and data limitations due to national-level aggregation

- Greenwashing risks in net-zero and carbon neutrality claims

- Ethics are treated as core to environmental analytics, not an afterthought.

# Key Skills Demonstrated

- Environmental & sustainability analytics

- Longitudinal emissions analysis

- Policy-oriented data interpretation

- ESG and SBTi alignment

- Ethical risk assessment in analytics

- Translating data into executive-level recommendations

# Who This Project Is For

- Sustainability & ESG analysts

- Climate policy and public sector roles

- Environmental consulting

- Strategy and impact-focused analytics positions

# Key Takeaway

Environmental data is only valuable when it shapes credible, ethical and actionable policy. This project demonstrates how analytics, governance and ethics must work together to enable a just and science-based transition to net-zero.
