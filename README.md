# Net Zero Agriculture in Pakistan
# Project Overview

This project applies environmental analytics to assess the feasibility of achieving net-zero emissions in Pakistan’s agricultural sector, which currently contributes 41% of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using 52 years of longitudinal emissions data (1970-2022), the project identifies emission trends, pollutant hotspots, governance gaps and proposes SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative)-aligned, data-driven policy recommendations. The analysis is written from the perspective of a senior policy or sustainability decision-maker, translating quantitative evidence into actionable climate strategy.

# Project Context

Pakistan has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, yet agriculture remains:

- Agricultural GHG emissions increased by 268% since 1970
- Emissions data remains nationally aggregated with no farm-level MRV
- No binding caps or sector-specific thresholds
- No SBTi-aligned agriculture roadmap

Despite decades of rising emissions, the sector lacks:

- A dedicated net-zero roadmap
- Robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems
- Emissions-linked incentives or accountability mechanisms

This project addresses these gaps using environmental data analytics.

# Data Sources

The project relies exclusively on secondary, open-access data.

## Primary Dataset

- EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research)
- **Coverage:** 1970-2022
- **Sector:** Agriculture (Pakistan)

## Emissions Covered

- **Greenhouse Gases:** CO₂, CH₄, N₂O (CO₂-equivalent)
- **Air Pollutants:** NH₃, NOx, CO, SO₂, Black Carbon
- **Toxic Pollutant:** Mercury (Hg)

The dataset enables long-term trend analysis and source-level hotspot identification for selected pollutants.

# Methodology

The analytical workflow follows a structured environmental analytics approach:

- Data cleaning and structuring for statistical and visual analysis
- Descriptive statistics to establish baseline emissions behaviour
- Trend analysis across 52 years of longitudinal data
- Hotspot identification for NH₃ and NOx emissions by source
- Correlation analysis (Pearson) between time and emission variables
- System-level policy gap analysis
- Ethical risk assessment (data integrity, equity, greenwashing)

# Tools Used

- SPSS for descriptive statistics and correlation analysis

- Tableau for emissions visualisation and trend exploration

- Excel for data preparation and structuring

# Key Findings
## Emissions Trends

- Total agricultural GHG emissions increased from 69M tCO₂e/year (1970) to 255M tCO₂e/year (2022)
- GHG growth of 268% over the study period
- Strong, statistically significant correlations between time and emissions:
  - **GHG:** r = 0.971, p < 0.001
  - **NH₃:** r = 0.986, p < 0.001
  - **NOx:** r = 0.991, p < 0.001
**Emissions growth is systemic and structural, not cyclical or random.**

## Pollutant Hotspots

Agricultural soils dominate emissions:

- **NH₃:** 1.6M tonnes/year (2022)
- **NOx:** 135K tonnes/year (2022)

Manure management is a fast-growing secondary source:

- **NH₃:** 305K tonnes/year (2022)

Crop residue burning contributes disproportionately to:

- **CO:** 1.7M tonnes/year (2022)
- **BC:** 12.8K tonnes/year (2022)
- SO₂ and Hg both increased by 169% since 1970

## Structural Failures Identified

- No SBTi-aligned agriculture emissions roadmap
- Fertiliser subsidies of PKR 200B annually, encouraging nitrogen overuse
- Absence of compulsory manure management standards
- Weak sub-national emissions governance
- Limited transparency and MRV infrastructure

# Strategic Recommendations

The project proposes five targeted, data-backed interventions:

- National Agriculture Emissions Strategy
  - **Target:** 25% GHG reduction by 2035 (baseline: 2022)
- Fertiliser Subsidy Reform
  - **Target:** Convert 40% of Punjab & Sindh subsidies to climate-smart inputs by 2027
- Provincial Climate Units (PCUs)
  - **Target:** Operational MRV dashboards in 4 provinces by 2026
- National Manure Management Code
  - **Target:** 60% compliance among commercial farms by 2028
- Agriculture Carbon Council
  - **Target:** Mobilise PKR 200B in climate finance by 2030
Each recommendation includes clear KPIs and implementation timelines.

# Ethical Considerations

The project explicitly addresses:
- Data ethics and analytical integrity
- Equity and just transition risks for smallholder farmers
- Bias and data limitations due to national-level aggregation
- Greenwashing risks in net-zero and carbon neutrality claims
- Ethics are treated as core to environmental analytics, not an afterthought.

# Key Skills Demonstrated

- Environmental and sustainability analytics
- Longitudinal emissions analysis
- Policy-oriented data interpretation
- ESG and SBTi alignment
- Ethical risk assessment in analytics
- Translating data into executive-level recommendations

# Who This Project Is For

- Sustainability and ESG analysts
- Climate policy and public sector roles
- Environmental consulting
- Strategy and impact-focused analytics positions

# Key Takeaway

Environmental data is only valuable when it shapes credible, ethical and actionable policy. This project demonstrates how analytics, governance and ethics must work together to enable a just and science-based transition to net-zero.
